 * * obj = {name: "Deloba", weight: "14 lbs"}    <-- `obj` is the existing object
 * * obj["birthday"] = "01/10/2013"                <-- use bracket notation to set new key/value pair on `obj`
 * 
 * obj now has an added birthday property.
 * console.log(obj)
 * > {
 *  name: "Deloba",
 *  weight: "14 lbs"
 *  birthday: "01/10/2013"
 * }
